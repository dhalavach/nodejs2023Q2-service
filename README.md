# Home Library Service - Prisma, Postgres, and Docker (part 2)

## Prerequisites

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.
- Docker - [Download & Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

## Downloading

```
git clone git@github.com:dhalavach/nodejs2023Q2-service.git
```

switch to auth branch:

```
git checkout auth
```

## Installing node modules

Node modules are necessary for running tests. To install, run:

```
npm install
```

in the unlikely event of error during the installation process, run:

```
npm install --force
```

## Environment

make sure you have .env file in the root of the project with all the variables from .env.example

## Docker

download, install, and launch Docker

## Build images

To build images and start containers, run:

```
npm run docker:build
```

I strongly recommend cleaning the cache and removing networks/images before you build. To clean, run:

```
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

After starting the app on port (5000 by default) you can run the tests (please make sure that nothing else is running on port 5000 - other container or some app, such as Mac Os Control Center which often uses this port)

## Docker Hub

The images are available on the Docker Hub. Search for kopfmann/homelibservice-auth-app and kopfmann/homelibservice-auth-db. To pull the images and start the containers, run:

```
npm run docker:pull
```

## Testing

After installing the dependencies, building the images, and starting the containers, open new terminal and run:

```
npm run test:auth
```

ATTENTION: Occasionally, the app takes some time to start inside the docker container, please wait if you encounter "socket hang up" error during tests (you can check the container's log in docker desktop to make sure that the app has started). However, if you are on M1 Mac, system and Docker restart might be required to fix this error. A variation of this error is when only one test suite fails - it also means that the app has not fully started inside the container. Simply wait a little, try again, and all tests will pass!

### Linter

To check for warnings and errors run

```
npm run lint
```

NB: false positive eslint warning with nest are a known bug, no-unused-vars gives an unneccessary warning in nest constructors

### Vulnerabilities scan

To scan the images for vulnerabiities and recommendations using Docker Scout run:

```
npm run docker:scan
```

### Errors

if you encounter errors, consider pruning the system and then build images again

```
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

WARNING: this will delete your unused images/containers and networks! run the command above only if you know what you are doing
